### Engine core features implementation

- [ ] Review all TODOS/FIXME
- [x] Configuration header lib(config.h)
- [x] Entry Point
- [x] Main Loop
- [ ] Memory
    - [x] Memory taggin
    - [ ] Hijack SGDK's memory allocation libraries to use a custom one
- [ ] Input
    - [x] Basic input handling(pooling)
    - [ ] Implement other Joycons pooling
    - [ ] Investigate is using the SGDK input event is better then pooling once per frame    
- [ ] Command
    - [ ] Input buffer (with configurable delay)
    - [ ] Command event pattherns (qcf: Hadoken)    
- [x] Logger
- [ ] Asserts
    - [x] Basic assert validation (with or without message)
    - [ ] Implement an "fmt" parameter while setting asserts.
- [x] Profiler
- [ ] ECS
    - [x] Basic ECS implementation
    - [ ] Improve performance while adding removing components(MACRO BASED implementation?)
    - [ ] Improve performance while addin and removing entities (Head/tail and component swap)
        - [ ] Consider implementing Groups(entitties with same components), SparseSets(Keep everthing cache friendly), Pagination(Avoid long unused arrays in memory)
- [ ] Components
    - [x] Position component
    - [x] Velocity component
    - [x] Sprite component
    - [ ] Acceleration component
    - [ ] Input component
    - [ ] Collider component
- [ ] System
    - [ ] Acelleration system
    - [x] Movement system
    - [x] Rendering system
    - [ ] Collision system
    - [ ] Input system
    - [ ] Sound System
- [ ] Event
    - [x] Basic event system implementation
    - [ ] Implement delay event system(into a buffer). To avoid immediate call    
- [ ] Scene
    - [x] Basic scene transition
    - [ ] Attach scene to all entities created within it
    - [ ] Scene transition effects
- [ ] Physycs
    - [ ] 2d colligin physycs (huge)
    - [ ] 2d vector math library
- [ ] Unit/regression tests
- [ ] Installation
- [ ] Finite state machine
    - [ ] ECS/NON ECS VERSION
- [ ] Global
    - [ ] windows width and heigh initialization(For generic calculations)
